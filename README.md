# my homelab setup

This repo the setup for my homelab.

It currently consists of a server running Fedora CoreOS. I'm currently in the
process of migrating my setup to kubernetes, which is deployed on a
Pine64 RockPro64 for testing.

Until this transition is done, the state of this repo is constantly changing,
which makes updating the readme cumbersome, so it has not content (for now).
